# Service Oriented Approach
#   -Most non-trivial web applications use servics
#   -They use servics from other applications
#       Credit Card Charge
#       Hotel Reservation systems
#   - Servics puclich the "rule" application must follow to make use of the service(API)
# 
# Multiple Systems
#   - Initially - two systems cooperate and split the problem
#   - As the data/service becomes useful - multiple applicartions want to use the information/ application
